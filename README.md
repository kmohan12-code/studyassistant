studyAssistant with Google Gemini

This project is a web-based AI assistant that allows you to upload a PDF document and ask questions about its content. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline powered by Google's Gemini Pro model and LangChain to provide intelligent and context-aware answers.

Features
Interactive UI: A clean and user-friendly interface for uploading files and chatting.

PDF Upload: Supports uploading PDF documents via button click or drag-and-drop.

Document Processing: Extracts text from the PDF, splits it into manageable chunks, and creates a searchable vector index.

Conversational Q&A: Ask questions in natural language and receive answers generated by a powerful AI model based on the document's content.

Powered by Gemini: Utilizes Google's gemini-2.5-pro for high-quality responses and embedding-001 for text embeddings.

Tech Stack
Backend: Python, FastAPI

AI/ML: LangChain, Google Generative AI (Gemini), FAISS (for vector storage)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

PDF Processing: PyPDF2

How It Works
The application follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture:

PDF Processing: When a user uploads a PDF, the backend extracts all text content.

Text Chunking: The extracted text is split into smaller, overlapping chunks to ensure semantic context is preserved.

Vector Embedding: Each text chunk is converted into a numerical vector representation (embedding) using Google's models/embedding-001.

Vector Store: These embeddings are stored in a local FAISS vector store, which allows for efficient similarity searches.

Question Answering: When a user asks a question:

The question is converted into an embedding.

The FAISS store is searched to find the text chunks with embeddings most similar to the question's embedding.

These relevant chunks (the context) and the original question are passed to the Gemini Pro model via a carefully crafted prompt.

The model generates a final, human-like answer based on the provided context.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to run the project locally.

Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

A Google API Key with the "Generative Language API" enabled. You can get one from the Google AI Studio.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/pdf-qna-assistant.git](https://github.com/your-username/pdf-qna-assistant.git)
cd pdf-qna-assistant

2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the Goodies
This project has a few dependencies. You can install them all at once. First, create a requirements.txt file in your project's main folder and paste this inside:

fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
python-dotenv
google-generativeai
langchain-google-genai
langchain
pypdf2
faiss-cpu

Now, just run this command in your terminal to install everything:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Add Your API Key
The assistant needs your Google API key to work its magic. We'll keep it safe in an environment file.

Create a new file named .env in the main project folder. Inside that file, add your key like this:

GOOGLE_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE"

Make sure to replace the placeholder with your actual key!

5. Fire It Up!
You're all set! To start the app, run the following command in your terminal:

uvicorn app:app --reload

The --reload flag is handy because it automatically restarts the server whenever you make code changes.

Once it's running, open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000. You should see the PDF assistant ready to go!

How the Files Are Organized
Here’s a quick look at how the project is laid out:

.
├── app.py              # The heart of our backend server
├── templates/
│   └── index.html      # The main (and only) HTML page
├── static/
│   ├── style.css       # Makes everything look pretty
│   └── script.js       # Powers all the interactive features
├── .env                # Where your secret API key lives
├── requirements.txt    # A list of the Python tools we need
└── README.md           # You're reading it!

Under the Hood: API Endpoints
For those curious, here are the API endpoints that power the app:

GET /: Loads the main page when you visit the site.

POST /upload_pdf/: Kicks into gear when you upload a PDF. It reads the file, chops up the text, and gets it ready for questions.

POST /ask/: Handles your questions. It finds the relevant parts of the PDF and asks the AI to come up with an answer.
